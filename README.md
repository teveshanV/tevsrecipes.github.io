# tevsrecipes.github.io
I made a recipe website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus of this project was to provide a clean interface for users 
who want recipes without cycling through multiple pages or scrolling for longer than usual. 
This project helped me sharpen my CSS skills in terms of structuring, justifying, and positioning.
